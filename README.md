# Prompt reference for Langchain users

This guide highlights the various prompt formats supported by Langchain, a powerful tool for working with language models. With the introduction of LCEL (Langchain Expression Language), the prompt formats have evolved, offering enhanced functionality and flexibility.

## Usage

You can experiment with different prompts directly and observe immediate results. It is recommended to use a tool like Colab, which provides a convenient and interactive environment for testing prompts.

If you not interested in the evolution of Prompt templates, scroll all the way to the bottom and use Prompt Template and Chat Prompt Template. If you start from the top, you will appreciate how easier it had become now, instead of fiddling with input variables and confusing multiple ways to create prompt templates. Note that LCEL didnt invent new ways to create prompts, its just that LCEL made it more intuitive. Enjoy!
